 **HelmetDetection.py**

This script is designed for detecting helmets and motorcycles in images and videos. It includes the following components:

1. **GUI Setup**: Uses `tkinter` for creating a graphical user interface.
2. **Functions for Detection**:
   - `upload()`: To upload an image.
   - `detectBike()`: To detect motorcycles and persons in the uploaded image.
   - `detectHelmet()`: To detect helmets in the uploaded image.
   - `videoHelmetDetect()`: To detect helmets in video feed from the webcam.
3. **Button Configuration**: Sets up buttons for uploading images, detecting motorcycles, detecting helmets, and exiting the application.
4. **Detection Logic**: Utilizes OpenCV's DNN module for loading and processing YOLO (You Only Look Once) models.

**helmetnew.py**

This script extends or modifies the functionality of `HelmetDetection.py`, focusing on YOLO-based object detection with the following tasks:

1. **YOLO Model Loading and Configuration**: Loading pre-trained YOLO models for detecting objects.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Function to preprocess images before feeding them into the model.
3. **Post-processing**: Functions to process the model output and extract bounding boxes, confidences, and class IDs.
4. **Helper Functions**:
   - `load_yolo()`: Load the YOLO model.
   - `detect_objects()`: Detect objects using the YOLO model.
   - `get_box_dimensions()`: Get the dimensions of the bounding boxes.
   - `draw_labels()`: Draw labels and bounding boxes on the detected objects.

**yolo.py**

This script provides a generalized approach to YOLO detection, including:

1. **Model Initialization**: Load the YOLO model and configure input parameters.
2. **Object Detection**:
   - `process_frame()`: Process each frame of the input to detect objects.
   - `draw_boxes()`: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `load_yolo_model()`: Load the YOLO model.
   - `detect_from_image()`: Detect objects from a static image.
   - `detect_from_video()`: Detect objects from a video file or live feed.

**yoloDetection.py**

This script adds specific functionality for detecting and processing YOLO-based object detection results:

1. **Detection and Tracking**: Includes functions for detecting and tracking objects in images and videos.
2. **Bounding Box Processing**: Functions to handle bounding boxes and classify detected objects.
3. **Display Results**:
   - `displayImage()`: Display the processed image with bounding boxes.
   - `listBoundingBoxes()`: List all bounding boxes detected in an image.
   - `draw_boxes()`: Draw the bounding boxes on the image.

Overall, these scripts facilitate the detection of helmets and motorcycles in images and videos using YOLO models, with various utilities and a GUI for ease of use.
